25 Jun 2007      detpdb-1.0

    Build system improvements:

    * Compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005, Debugging Tools SDK 6.7.5.0 and
      IDA Pro SDK 5.1
    * Build a 32-bit and 64-bit version of the plugin
    * Link with the static version of the libc library

    Interface improvements:

    * The plugin can be disabled with the -Opdb:off option on the command line
    * The symbol path and options can be set in detpdb.cfg

    Algorithm improvements:

    * Support for 64-bit binaries (thanks to Matt Conover)
    * Load the VC type library for all files with symbols
    * Create structures for GUID variables
    * Ignore leading underscores of GUID variables

    Bugfixes:

    * Apply multiple names at the same address in alphabetical order instead of
      randomly
    * Fixed a refcount bug in the DbgHelp constructor
    * Added a __cdecl specifier to the Sym::compare function used by qsort
    * Fixed memory corruption bug due to lack of a copy constructor (thanks to
      Ilfak Guilfanov)
    * Don't rely on wchar_t being 16 bits

14 Jun 2006     detpdb-0.4

    * Released at Recon

    Build system improvements:
    
    * Compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0, Debugging Tools SDK 6.6 and
      IDA Pro SDK 5.0
    * Enabled optimization and removal of unreferenced functions

    GUI improvements:

    * Print the address in the beginning of warnings and error messages,
      allowing you to jump to the error location by clicking on the line
    * Both ASCII and Unicode strings are shown as type "String" in the GUI
    * GUIDs are created as four dwords instead of 16 bytes because they take
      less space on the screen

    Algorithm improvements:

    * Apply symbols in multiple passes
    * More accurate detection of string types (ASCII and UNICODE)
    * Existing names are renamed to avoid name clashes
    * Undefine tail bytes if they prevent the creation of a symbol name
    * Truncate names to the maximum length supported by IDA (currently 512)
    * Check for enough space before creating data symbols

    Bugfixes:

    * Fixed creation of doubles and GUIDs, don't leave their bytes undefined
    * Added a prototype for Symbols::~Symbols
    * Disabled the macro redefinition warning for dbghelp.h

13 Apr 2006     detpdb-0.3

    * Internal release

    GUI improvements:

    * Changed hotkey to Ctrl-4 to avoid clash with BinDiff 2.0 alphas
    * More detailed error message for unknown symbol types

    Algorithm improvements:

    * Added detection and creation of GUID variables
    * Detect demangled names that are the same as the mangled ones
    * Handle imports in the text segment that look like functions
    * Undefine existing bytes before creating new data items
    * Disabled function creation during vtable processing, it was causing
      problems with function chunking

4 Apr 2006      detpdb-0.2

    * Released at CanSecWest

    GUI improvements:
      
    * Show symbol types and icons in the chooser window
    * Sort the symbols in the chooser window by the address

    Algorithm improvements:

    * Turned off SYMOPT_ALLOW_ABSOLUTE_SYMBOLS
    * Added special handling for functions, imports, real literals and vtables
    * Apply the symbols starting from the end of the file and going up. This
      improves the function chunking significantly.

    Bugfixes:

    * Disabled warnings for the IDA SDK header files
    * Fixed a bug in the return value of DbgHelp::SymFunctionTableAccess64

12 Mar 2006     detpdb-0.1

    * Uses the same algorithm as the PDB plugin in IDA 4.9 SP
    * Compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1, Debugging Tools SDK 6.6 and
      IDA Pro SDK 4.9 SP
